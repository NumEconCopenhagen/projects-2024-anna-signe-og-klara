# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **DataProject** and is about movie data. The data stems from DST and is from 2015-2023. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. BIO05.csv (*Danmarks Statistik*) 

Due to problems with combining py.file and jupiter.file the entire code script is in the jupiter-file. We plan to fix this in the future.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
