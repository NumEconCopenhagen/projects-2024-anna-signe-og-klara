    "In order to answer the question above, firstly, we assume that the economy is in equlibrium with the prices p1 and p2 above, yielding that the market clarings conditions are met. From this equilibrium, we shock the model by introducting two taxes, one being the tax on consumption of c2 in form of a carbon emission tax, and one being the lumpsum transfering back to the consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the social welfare function, we see that there is a negative externality attached to consumption of good 2, which \n",
    "implies that the social optimal consumption of c2 is lower than in the market equilibrium, as the markets price doesn't reflect the social cost.\n",
    "\n",

    "We calculate the consumption of the two goods after the carbon emission tax is being introduced and lump-sum transfered from the government to the consumers as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "First of, we see that the tax on carbon emission only affects the demand for c2, hereby implying that there is no carbon emission from c1. In practice, c2 are effected by the carbon tax by implying a higher effective price for the good. Before the price was simply p2, though after introducing the tax - the price is effectively given by $p2+\\tau$. As $\\tau>0$ we find a increase in the price for c2. This would lead to a lower demand for c2 relative to c1, which is exactly what we find when calculating the consumption of the two goods following the demand. Hereby there is a degree of possibility for subtitution, as we see that the consumers change their consumption towards c1. If the carbon tax were to increase, we would most likely find a even greater substitution towards c1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that the lumpsum transfer is a direct compensation to the consumer funded by the tax revenue, as this is given by $T=\\tau\\times c2^*$. This transfer helps to redistribute income and possibly mitigate the negative effects of the tax on household consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal tax rate of 0.47 reflects a balance between raising enough revenue to fund transfers and not overburdening households to the point where their consumption and labor supply decisions significantly lower overall welfare. Where te lump-sum transfer is a crucial element, as it helps to alleviate the burden of the tax on households by returning some of the collected tax revenue, which supports their consumption and labor supply decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximized SWF function yields a value of -0.63. This might be explained by the general social negative effect there is associated with the consumption of c2. Even though, a tax of $\\tau=0.47$ is introduced, the social cost, reflecting the negative externality, is not high enough to compensate for the negative social cost associated with c2, therefore - the social welfare function is negative even though we set the optimal tax rate."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the graduates are able to change their career after one year we observe a slight change in the shares and utility. The pattern is though the same: the share of graduates in career 3 still increases by number of friends, and decreases in career 1 and 2 by the number of friends. Though the decrease is smaller for career 2 and the increase is smaller for career 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the utility we actually observe that the average realized utility actually increases a lot and ends up being larger than the average expected utility. This implies that the graduates actually underestimate their own utility from changing career based on the utility from their friends. This implies that the friends utility might not represent the utility the graduate gains from changing career. This could be due to the fact that the gain in utility is now relative to what have been observed before, which can make the gain in utility seem even larger if the graduate was unhappy about their previous career.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Above we have also printed the share of graduates switching careers, based on what career they are switching from. In line with the observed utility from the three careers, most graduates choose to switch career if they where originally in career 1, where also a positive trend is observed for the number of friends. The second most people switch from career 2, which seems to not really have a trend. The least people switch from career 3, which has a negative trend depending on number of friends. \n",

    "All in all this implies that the more friends the graduate have, and thereby the more observation you can make judgment on behalf of, the more correct will your expectations be."
